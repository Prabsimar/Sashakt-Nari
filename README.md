# Sashakt-Nari
Due to the drastic increase in the crime rates, A huge percentage of women have no faith that police can curb such harassment cases. So, to increase the faith in police and to make Women Empowered, We are trying to make a Software integrated Hardware Device which will help women to send her current location to her trusted people as well as to the police by three paths – 1. By using the internet of the user. 2. By sending SMS on trusted contact numbers and also at Women helpline number. 3. By Wireless mesh technology which could even work when there is no internet or mobile network At the same time, till the police arrives at the location, the women will be able to protect herself by a Stun gun that she will be carrying inside that device. As the name suggests “Sashakt”, Which means Empowered/strong/vigorous.
